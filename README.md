# MappingWithKeys.sol

Nothing fancy. Just a simple, easy, out-of-the-box mapping with keys in Solidity programming language.

When you know that you need it, just feel free to import and use in your projects.

Attention: it might be expensive, be aware of the time complexity of some operations. 

Good luck.
